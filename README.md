# Multi-Objective-prize-collecting-vehicle-routing-problem

Mixed integer programming for the prize-collecting vehicle routing problem implemented in python
The Prize-Collecting Vehicle Routing can be stated as the following: given a graph (set of nodes and edges), build a trip schedule starting and ending at the same depot, making sure to:
  - Flow constraint is respected
  - Capacity of a vehicle is respected
  - If a customer is visited, its demand should be satisfied
While maximizing the profit of visiting each customer (objective 1) and minimizing the total travel time (objective 2)
